Visualization of Rails bits
===========================

I find myself writing little rake tasks to visualize various aspects of a rails
application.  These make use of graphviz, http://graphviz.org , to generate the
pngs.

I work also exclusively on linux boxes, so these tasks may not work on other
OSes.

aasmviz.rake
============

This generates a png of a state machine defined by AASM
(git://github.com/rubyist/aasm.git).  Start and End states are shown in a
double circle and the event edges are labelled with the event name.

To use: rake aasm:visual

  1. Check out this project
  2. copy lib/tasks/aasmviz.rake to your RAILS_ROOT/lib/tasks directory.
  3. rake aasm:visual # from your RAILS_ROOT directory

This will generate a list of pngs called /tmp/aasm_model_name.png.  Only models
that inherit directly from ActiveRecord::Base will be examined.  In other
words, any tableless or STI models will not have png's generated for any AASM
they may define.

Still to do

1. incorporate guard definitions
2. incorporate success definitions
3. Look in places other than app/models/*.rb for potential model definitions.
